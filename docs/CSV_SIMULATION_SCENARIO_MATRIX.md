# Deterministic CSV simulation scenario matrix

This v3.2.2 test-only matrix contains 58 explicit scenario contracts across 54 CSV price-path files. It extends verification without changing `app/` or `main.py`.

Every scenario asserts an exact final stage and event sequence. Applicable contracts also assert quantities, trigger/fill prices, order payloads, P/L direction and arithmetic, budget exposure, minimum-profit preservation, RTH blocking/reopening, protective exits, and error text. Shared invariants reject overfills, duplicate lifecycle events, SELL-before-BUY ordering, non-app order references, non-maximal whole-share sizing, and inconsistent completed-cycle P/L.

## Scenario catalog

|---|---|---|---|

## Interpretation limits

These are deterministic strategy simulations. They do not reproduce exchange queue priority, all TWS trigger-method details, live latency, rejections, permissions, buying power, real market-data availability, server-side order handling, or actual disconnect timing. Passing the matrix detects rule and accounting regressions; it does not prove live profitability or end-to-end IBKR execution reliability.
