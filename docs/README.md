# Documentation index

The files in this directory describe the current v3.8.0 behavior unless explicitly marked otherwise. The root of `docs/` is intentionally limited to current operating, design, recovery, and verification material. Superseded release notes are stored under [`legacy/`](legacy/README.md).

When documents disagree, use this source-of-truth order:

1. executable source and current automated tests;
2. the root [`README.md`](../README.md) and current guides below;
3. the current release entry in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md);
4. archived notes only for implementation history.

## Current release note

[`V3_8_0_BUY_PARTIAL_FILL_GRACE.md`](V3_8_0_BUY_PARTIAL_FILL_GRACE.md) records the fixed three-second marketable-BUY partial-fill grace, timeout and safety cancellation conditions, restart-safe timing, audit evidence, compatibility, and regression scope. The detailed current watchdog contract remains in [`WORKER_WATCHDOG_AND_AUTO_RECOVERY.md`](WORKER_WATCHDOG_AND_AUTO_RECOVERY.md).

## Archived documentation

The [`legacy/`](legacy/README.md) directory contains all superseded release-specific notes and retained historical reports. Only the current v3.8.0 release note remains in the root of `docs/`. Archived files may accurately describe the release that introduced a feature, but labels, defaults, layouts, tests, and limitations in them can be obsolete. They are not the current operating specification.
