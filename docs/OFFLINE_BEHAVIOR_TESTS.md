# Deterministic offline behavior tests

This document describes the current non-GUI, non-Windows, non-network test layer in v3.4.0. It covers strategy behavior, controller state transitions, broker-event handling, persistence and recovery, shutdown checkpoints, GUI contracts, and bounded performance behavior.

The suite deliberately avoids:

- launching the PySide6 GUI;
- Windows-specific executable, registry, process, DPI, or native-widget behavior;
- a real TWS or IB Gateway process;
- paper or live IBKR accounts;
- real market data, account data, orders, fills, or network traffic.

The tests use temporary SQLite databases, deterministic clocks and prices, protocol-shaped broker doubles, subprocesses, and generated event sequences. They verify the application contract at its internal and adapter boundaries, not the behavior of IBKR's external systems.

## Test layers

### Broker callback replay and permutation

v3.2.0 retains the broker-validation and v3.1.2 reconciliation coverage and adds focused tests for exact USD/EUR SMART contract selection, one-currency database enforcement, capability and market-session validation, commission-currency mismatch handling, and fixed ten-second indefinite reconnect behavior.

`tests/test_broker_event_replay_permutations.py` replays equivalent order histories with callbacks in different orders. It covers open-order, order-status, execution, and commission events; duplicate execution identifiers; repeated terminal polls; persisted raw events; and idempotent replay.

The primary invariant is that harmless callback ordering and duplicate delivery must not change the final cycle, quantity, commission, or database state.

### Generated controller state sequences

`tests/test_stateful_controller_invariants.py` drives the real controller, strategy engine, and SQLite storage through deterministic generated scenarios. It covers complete and partial BUY/SELL paths, zero and nonzero trails, external positions, app-owned quantities, connectivity failures, retry behavior, and maximum-cycle enforcement.

The assertions include:

- no order transmission while a required guard is active;
- no SELL above app-owned unsold quantity;
- external positions do not become app-owned;
- no extra cycle after the configured maximum;
- completed cycles have no remaining app-owned quantity;
- repeated recovery information is idempotent.

### Generated numerical and malformed-payload properties

`tests/test_generated_numeric_and_payload_properties.py` applies deterministic generated inputs to pricing, quantity, profit-protection, serialization, and broker-payload normalization functions. It includes threshold-adjacent values, large and small finite values, malformed fields, and nonfinite values.

These are property-style tests: they assert invariants across many generated cases rather than checking only one example.

### Recovery and guard decision matrices

`tests/test_recovery_and_guard_decision_matrix.py` exercises combinations of local/upstream connectivity, missing or stale prices, RTH state, ATR readiness, app-owned positions, external positions, and recovery confidence.

The matrix verifies that normal trading guards remain distinct from recovery-required states and that fail-closed behavior is consistent across combinations.

### Differential simulation

`tests/test_differential_simulation_equivalence.py` runs generated price paths through independent simulation paths and compares stage transitions, order actions, trigger behavior, filled quantity, completion, and P/L within the documented rounding tolerance.

The comparison is intended to detect drift between simulation implementations. It does not model exchange queue priority, latency, broker-side trigger details, or real slippage.

### Multi-instance isolation

`tests/test_multi_instance_isolation.py` creates two controllers with separate roots, SQLite databases, client IDs, tickers, local ledgers, backups, and audit output while sharing one deterministic Gateway model.

It verifies normal client-isolated operation and Master-client shared-feed behavior. The current implementation requires the complete persisted `OrderRef`, so an unmatched order from another installation remains unowned even when it shares the `IBKRBOT` prefix.

### Crash, restart, migration, and restore

`tests/test_crash_restart_and_migration_matrix.py` uses child processes and abrupt `os._exit()` termination to test committed and uncommitted SQLite boundaries. It also covers zero-byte databases, reconstructed legacy schemas, migration idempotence, corrupt databases, startup backups, and backup validity after an abrupt writer exit.

These tests verify SQLite/application recovery semantics. They do not claim to reproduce every operating-system cache, filesystem, or hardware power-loss behavior.

### Storage fault injection and retention

`tests/test_storage_fault_injection_and_retention.py` injects failures into readable audit logging, restore-copy creation, backup integrity validation, validation-report writing, capture ZIP writing, and backup rotation. It verifies exact retention behavior at multiple limits and checks filename sanitation and fallback exports.

### Gateway outage and stale-data sequences

`tests/test_gateway_fault_injection_sequences.py` generates local and upstream connection failures, codes 1100 and 2110, restoration with and without market-data loss, repeated flapping, stale cached snapshots, recovery failures, and a connectivity race at the final order-placement boundary.

The deterministic assertions verify that:

- cached pre-outage data is never reclassified as fresh;
- ATR and strategy advancement require a new event;
- new orders remain blocked while connectivity or reconciliation is uncertain;
- subscription replacement/retention follows the restoration mode;
- a final connectivity check prevents a late-race order submission.

### Bounded soak tests

`tests/test_accelerated_soak_bounds.py` is marked `soak`. The complete Windows `run_all_tests.bat` gate now runs it inside the same Coverage.py invocation as every other pytest test; the Unix helper retains a separate non-instrumented soak pass. It verifies bounded behavior under:

- 25,000 market-data capture snapshots;
- 2,000 ATR bar buckets;
- 22,500 unique price events plus 1,000 duplicate reads;
- 250 completed persisted cycles;
- 1,000 upstream disconnect/restore cycles.

The tests check configured deque limits, ATR history limits, price-history limits, sequence deduplication, cycle/reinvestment totals, event draining, subscription generations, and thread-count stability. They are deterministic functional soak tests, not hardware performance benchmarks.

### Sanitized production-incident replay

`tests/test_production_incident_replays.py` uses compact fixtures reduced from the available IREN, NBIS, and VWRA audit evidence. The tests drive production controller, storage, strategy, and adapter-normalization paths for invalid-price rejection, partial-fill cancellation races, late commissions, strict foreign-`OrderRef` isolation, delayed data, broker-valid Stage-3 SELL rounding, and LSE session characterization. `tests/test_v321_incident_gap_fixes.py` verifies the corrected LSE/LSEETF continuous boundary, stable repeated-block throttling, and the distinct `PreflightBlocked` status. `tests/test_incident_fixture_integrity.py` enforces fixture provenance and privacy. See [`PRODUCTION_INCIDENT_REPLAY_TESTS.md`](PRODUCTION_INCIDENT_REPLAY_TESTS.md).

### Safety mutation smoke gate

`scripts/run_mutation_smoke.py` copies the application package into temporary directories, applies one deliberate defect at a time, and runs an independent probe. Production sources are never edited in place.

The gate currently requires tests to kill seventeen safety mutations:

1. reversing BUY slippage sizing;
2. excluding an exact BUY trailing-stop boundary;
3. excluding an exact SELL trailing-stop boundary;
4. excluding the exact initial-drop boundary;
5. using the larger instead of overlapping BUY/SELL quantity for P/L;
6. using the wrong completed-exit leg when calculating app-owned unsold quantity;
7. rounding a BUY order price downward instead of upward;
8. rounding a SELL order price upward instead of downward;
9. selecting the old market-rule band at an exact low-edge boundary;
10. sending a what-if trailing order with `transmit=False`;
11. allowing a second contract currency into a locked database;
12. changing the automatic reconnect interval away from ten seconds;
13. counting the same IBKR execution identifier more than once;
14. allowing a late zero commission to erase an already recorded non-zero commission;
15. moving the verified LSE continuous close from 16:30 to 16:50 London;
16. relabelling a local BUY preflight block as `SubmitFailed`; and
17. suppressing the first throttled warning when monotonic time starts at zero.

A surviving mutant fails the validation run.

## Deterministic broker support

`tests/support/deterministic_broker.py` implements the application-visible broker boundary in memory. It provides independent local and upstream connection states, event-stamped market data, order placement/cancellation, partial and terminal fills, execution history, recovery snapshots, account lists, and injected failures.

`tests/support/controller_harness.py` creates controllers with isolated SQLite storage and permissive settings so tests can focus on the behavior under examination.

The doubles intentionally do not import a live IB session, open sockets, or claim to reproduce undocumented server behavior.

## Validation sequence

The complete Windows launcher runs the deterministic layers in this order:

1. Compile `app`, `tests`, `scripts`, and `main.py`.
2. Run every collected pytest test, including the bounded soak tests, with `ResourceWarning` promoted to an error and Coverage.py branch tracking enabled. No marker filter is applied.
3. Enforce the 75% combined statement/branch threshold.
4. Write `coverage.json` and `coverage.xml`.
5. Require entry into every effective executable application callable.
6. Run the seventeen-mutant safety smoke gate.
7. Run all deterministic CSV simulations.
8. Run Ruff and Pyright through `run_all_tests.bat`.

The Unix `scripts/run_tests.sh` helper still separates non-soak coverage from the soak subset to keep that development-host command practical.

The corrected v3.4.0 source tree executed **1,118/1,118** collected pytest cases across isolated coverage partitions with `ResourceWarning` promoted to an error. The combined instrumented run included the ordinary, accelerated-soak, and elapsed-time-bound large-database tests, measured **77.8%** combined statement/branch coverage, and entered **992/992** executable application callables. The release also killed **17/17** targeted safety mutants and passed **58/58** deterministic simulation contracts across 54 CSV price paths. The three former strict expected failures remain ordinary passing regressions.

The CSV matrix itself passes cleanly in the offline Linux environment. The full Windows launcher remains the authoritative combined run for Coverage.py, Ruff, Pyright, and native launcher behavior.

## Scope that remains external

The following still require separate environments and are intentionally not part of this offline layer:

- actual PySide6 widget rendering and user interaction;
- native Windows locking, process, DPI, and packaged-executable behavior;
- a real TWS/IB Gateway handshake and callback stream;
- paper-account or live-account order lifecycle tests;
- real market-data entitlements, pacing, fills, commissions, margin, and exchange behavior;
- true Internet interruption between Gateway and IBKR;
- hardware-specific latency, CPU, memory, and endurance qualification.
